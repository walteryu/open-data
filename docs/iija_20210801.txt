United States; 
(B) the continuing barriers described in 
subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
disadvantaged business enterprise program;

testimony and documentation of race and gender 
discrimination from numerous sources, including 
congressional hearings and roundtables, 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

scientific reports, reports issued by public and 
private agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination 
by organizations and individuals, 
and discrimination lawsuits, which show that 
race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient 
to address the problem; 

(D) the testimony and documentation described 
in subparagraph (C) demonstrate that 
discrimination across the United States poses a 
barrier to full and fair participation in surface 
transportation-related businesses of women

aspects of surface transportation-related business 
in the public and private markets; and 
(E) the testimony and documentation described

continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise

discrimination in surface transportation-related 
business.

COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, 

AND TERRITORIES 
SEC. 60101. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1) Access to affordable, reliable, high-speed 
broadband is essential to full participation in modern 
life in the United States. 
(2) The persistent ‘‘digital divide’’ in the 
United States is a barrier to the economic competitiveness 
of the United States and equitable distribution 
of essential public services, including health care 
and education. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

(3) The digital divide disproportionately affects 
communities of color, lower-income areas, and rural 
areas, and the benefits of broadband should be 
broadly enjoyed by all. 
(4) In many communities across the country, 
increased competition among broadband providers 
has the potential to offer consumers more affordable, 
high-quality options for broadband service. 
(5) The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has 
underscored the critical importance of affordable, 
high-speed broadband for individuals, families, and 
communities to be able to work, learn, and connect 
remotely while supporting social distancing.

PART I—BUY AMERICA SOURCING 
REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 70911. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds that— 

(1) the United States must make significant investments 
to install, upgrade, or replace the public 
works infrastructure of the United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the infrastructure 
of the United States, taxpayers expect that 
their public works infrastructure will be produced in 
the United States by American workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested in 
public infrastructure should not be used to reward 
companies that have moved their operations, investment 
dollars, and jobs to foreign countries or foreign 
factories, particularly those that do not share or 
openly flout the commitments of the United States 
to environmental, worker, and workplace safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed Federal assistance 
should give a commonsense procurement 
preference for the materials and products produced 
by companies and workers in the United States in 
accordance with the high ideals embodied in the en

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and other 
regulatory requirements of the United States; 

(5) common construction materials used in public 
works infrastructure projects, including steel, 
iron, manufactured products, non-ferrous metals, 
plastic and polymer-based products (including 
polyvinylchloride, composite building materials, and 
polymers used in fiber optic cables), glass (including 
optic glass), lumber, and drywall are not adequately 
covered by a domestic content procurement preference, 
thus limiting the impact of taxpayer purchases 
to enhance supply chains in the United 
States; 
(6) the benefits of domestic content procurement 
preferences extend beyond economics; 
(7) by incentivizing domestic manufacturing, 
domestic content procurement preferences reinvest 
tax dollars in companies and processes using the 
highest labor and environmental standards in the 
world; 
(8) strong domestic content procurement preference 
policies act to prevent shifts in production to 
countries that rely on production practices that are 
significantly less energy efficient and far more polluting 
than those in the United States; 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

(9) for over 75 years, Buy America and other 
domestic content procurement preference laws have 
been part of the United States procurement policy, 
ensuring that the United States can build and rebuild 
the infrastructure of the United States with 
high-quality American-made materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this Act, 
a domestic content procurement preference requirement 
may not apply, may apply only to a narrow 
scope of products and materials, or may be limited 
by waiver with respect to many infrastructure programs, 
which necessitates a review of such programs, 
including programs for roads, highways, and 
bridges, public transportation, dams, ports, harbors, 
and other maritime facilities, intercity passenger and 
freight railroads, freight and intermodal facilities, 
airports, water systems, including drinking water 
and wastewater systems, electrical transmission facilities 
and systems, utilities, broadband infrastructure, 
and buildings and real property; 
(11) Buy America laws create demand for domestically 
produced goods, helping to sustain and 
grow domestic manufacturing and the millions of 
jobs domestic manufacturing supports throughout 
product supply chains; 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

(12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
domestic content procurement preference policies 
apply to all Federal Government procurement and to 
various Federal-aid infrastructure programs; 
(13) a robust domestic manufacturing sector is 
a vital component of the national security of the 
United States; 
(14) as more manufacturing operations of the 
United States have moved offshore, the strength and 
readiness of the defense industrial base of the 
United States has been diminished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement preference 
laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the international 
obligations of the United States; and 
(B) together with the government procurements 
to which the laws apply, are important 
levers for ensuring that United States manufacturers 
can access the government procurement 
markets of the trading partners of the United 
States.

vulnerability of the United States supply chains for, 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

and lack of domestic production of, personal protective 
equipment (PPE). 

(2) The United States requires a robust, secure, 
and wholly domestic PPE supply chain to safeguard 
public health and national security. 
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the government’s 
anticipated needs over the next three years 
will enable suppliers to assess what changes, if any, 
are needed in their manufacturing capacity to meet 
expected demands. 
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE supply 
chain, United States industry needs a strong and 
consistent demand signal from the Federal Government 
providing the necessary certainty to expand 
production capacity investment in the United States. 
(5) In order to effectively incentivize investment 
in the United States and the re-shoring of manufacturing, 
long-term contracts must be no shorter than 
three years in duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United States 
should seek to ensure compliance with its international 
obligations, such as its commitments under 
the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government 
Procurement and its free trade agreements, 
including by invoking any relevant exceptions to 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

those agreements, especially those related to national 
security and public health. 

(7) The United States needs a long-term investment 
strategy for the domestic production of PPE 
items critical to the United States national response 
to a public health crisis, including the COVID–19 
pandemic.

SEC. 90003. FINDINGS REGARDING UNUSED UNEMPLOY


MENT INSURANCE FUNDS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1) On July 16, 2021, the Congressional Budget 
Office (in this section referred to as ‘‘CBO’’) reduced 
its projected cost of the extension of expanded 
unemployment compensation as enacted in the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117–2). 
(2) CBO budget projections included mandatory 
outlays for the expansion totaling $144,000,000,000 
in 2021 and $8,000,000,000 in 2022. That estimated 
cost is $50,000,000,000 less in 2021, and 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

EDW21A09 WG9 S.L.C. 

$3,000,000,000 less in 2022, than anticipated in 
CBO’s March 2021 cost estimate. 

(3) CBO reduced its projections of those costs 
for two major reasons. First, several States have announced 
that they are discontinuing one or more of 
the components of expanded unemployment compensation 
before the expansion’s authorization ends 
in September 2021. In its original estimate, CBO 
projected that all States would participate in the 
programs until September. Second, because of the 
improving economy, the agency has lowered its forecast 
of the unemployment rate, resulting in fewer 
projected beneficiaries for the programs, which also 
reduced projected costs. 
(4) It is estimated that there are approximately 
$53,000,000,000 in savings from the amounts in the 
Treasury originally estimated to be spent on unemployment 
insurance funds (under the provisions of 
subtitle A of title II of division A of the CARES 
Act) not used by the States.
